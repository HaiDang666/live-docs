# Resolution CLI

The Resolution-CLI is built and maintained by Unstoppable Domains. It is a simple CLI tool for resolving Unstoppable domains and interacting with blockchain domain names. It can be used to retrieve [payment addresses](../send-and-receive-crypto-payments/crypto-payments.md), IPFS hashes for [decentralized websites](../build-a-decentralized-website/overview-of-ipfs-and-d-websites.md), DNS records and other [records types](../domain-registry-essentials/records-reference.md).

The Resolution CLI supports decentralized domains for CNS, ZNS, and UNS, including the new TLD's \(.888, .nft, .coin, .blockchain, .wallet, .x, .bitcoin, .dao\).

For more information on resolving domains using the Resolution CLI option, please see the [Resolution CLI Repository](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution-cli) on Github.
