# Resolution Libraries

Resolution libraries are used for interacting with blockchain domain names. They can be used to retrieve [payment addresses](../send-and-receive-crypto-payments/crypto-payments.md), IPFS hashes for [decentralized websites](../build-a-decentralized-website/overview-of-ipfs-and-d-websites.md), DNS records and other [records types](../domain-registry-essentials/records-reference.md). Each Resolution Library is built and maintained by Unstoppable Domains, so updates happen automatically. 

## Supported Domains for Resolution Libraries

The Resolution Libraries support decentralized domains across three main zones:

| Name Service | Supported Domains |
| :--- | :--- |
| Zilliqa Name Service \(ZNS\) | `.zil` |
| Ethereum Name Service \(ENS\) | `.eth`, `.kred`, `.xyz`, `.luxe` |
| Unstoppable Name Service \(UNS\) | `.crypto`, `.nft`, `.blockchain`, `.bitcoin`, `.coin`, `.wallet,` `.888`, `.dao`, `.x` |
