# Getting Started

## I want to learn more about Unstoppable Domains

Unstoppable Domains are decentralized. This makes them, in a word, unstoppable. Once a user claims a domain to a wallet, they have absolute control over that domain. Domains can be transferred, updated, and linked to other services without any involvement from Unstoppable Domains. Unstoppable Domains cannot deactivate, change, or transfer a domain's records without a user's permission.

To learn more about the company, please browse our [general website](https://unstoppabledomains.com), watch the learning materials and videos from our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/UnstoppableDomains/videos), and listen to our popular, educational [UD Podcast Channel](https://open.spotify.com/show/2ZlyOpkkprGKS5KODk1PSS).

To learn more about how the product works under the hood, see the [CNS Architecture](domain-registry-essentials/architecture-overview/) and [CNS Smart Contracts](domain-registry-essentials/architecture-overview/cns-smart-contracts.md) or [UNS Architecture](domain-registry-essentials/uns-architecture-overview/) along with [UNS Smart Contracts](domain-registry-essentials/uns-architecture-overview/uns-smart-contracts.md). Also visit the [List of Integrated Apps](https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps) to draw inspiration from other apps that have successfully integrated Unstoppable Domains.

## I want to add Unstoppable Domains to my app to send and receive crypto

Unstoppable Domains supports 260+ cryptocurrencies. The most common way to integrate with Unstoppable Domains is through [simple domain resolution](domain-registry-essentials/resolving-domain-records.md). This process converts cryptocurrency addresses to a human-readable or user-friendly name. See the guides on [Crypto Payments](send-and-receive-crypto-payments/crypto-payments.md), [Resolution Libraries](send-and-receive-crypto-payments/resolution-libraries/), and [Library Configuration](send-and-receive-crypto-payments/resolution-libraries/library-configuration.md) for more detail on integrating UD into your app.

## I want to support Unstoppable Domains in my web browser

Allow your users of your browser to create and view decentralized websites. Individuals control their own content and identity with a decentralized website. The website is **decentralized**, by being created on the Ethereum blockchain, and the domain is stored in a user’s wallet, just like a cryptocurrency. This means that no one can delete content \(such as blogs, podcasts, artwork, social media\) or move it around other than the domain owner. See the guides on [Resolving Domains in a Browser](support-unstoppable-domains-in-a-web-browser/resolving-domains-in-a-browser.md) and [Browser Resolution Algorithm](support-unstoppable-domains-in-a-web-browser/browser-resolution-algorithm.md). For a list of test domains, see [Browser Resolution Test Domains](support-unstoppable-domains-in-a-web-browser/test-domains.md).

## I want to allow my users to manage their existing domains

Your app can edit domain metadata manually with a direct connection to the appropriate blockchain. We strongly recommend prior experience with blockchain development before starting this type of integration, so please familiarize yourself with [CNS Smart Contracts](domain-registry-essentials/architecture-overview/cns-smart-contracts.md) or [UNS Smart Contracts](domain-registry-essentials/uns-architecture-overview/uns-smart-contracts.md) along with [Managing Domain Records](allow-my-users-to-manage-existing-domains/managing-domain-records.md) and [Managing Domain Ownership](allow-my-users-to-manage-existing-domains/managing-domain-ownership/).

Popular open-source crypto wallet, MyEtherWallet, has implemented domain management and can be also used as a reference for implementation: [MyEtherWallet Code Reference](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/tree/master/src/dapps/Unstoppable) and [MyEtherWallet Website](https://www.myetherwallet.com).

## I want to sell domains to users in my app

If you want to resell domains, you must first [Register as A Reseller](sell-domains-to-users-in-my-app/register-as-reseller/) with Unstoppable Domains and configure your reseller account to accept [Stripe and/or CoinBase payments](sell-domains-to-users-in-my-app/register-as-reseller/setup-payment-methods.md). You may also visit the [Buy Domain: Reseller Demo](https://unstoppabledomains.github.io/reseller-demo/#/reseller-demo) to test out the platform before integration. See the [Reseller API Endpoints](sell-domains-to-users-in-my-app/reseller-api-endpoints.md) for interactive guides and detailed parameters.

## I want to build a decentralized website and link it to my domain

If you are new to IPFS and decentralized websites \(d-web\), we recommend that you start with the [IPFS Overview](build-a-decentralized-website/connecting-your-d-website-to-your-domain/#overview-of-ipfs-and-d-web). After purchasing a domain from UD, you can build your d-website using a [template](build-a-decentralized-website/connecting-your-d-website-to-your-domain/using-a-template-for-your-d-website.md) or [custom design](build-a-decentralized-website/connecting-your-d-website-to-your-domain/building-a-custom-d-website.md). See the guide on [Resolving a D-Website in a Browser](build-a-decentralized-website/resolving-a-d-website-in-a-browser.md) to view your d-website after [connecting it to your domain](build-a-decentralized-website/connecting-your-d-website-to-your-domain/).

## I want to promote my UD integration

We offer free advertising for UD integrated apps. Once your app has a working Unstoppable Domains integration, [register it here](https://unstoppabledomains.com/app-submission). Registered apps appear on the Unstoppable Domains [homepage](https://unstoppabledomains.com/) and [Applications](https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps) page — putting your app in front of tens of thousands of potential customers per day.

Also, every week we select a newly-integrated app to feature in the Unstoppable Update newsletter. This newsletter is delivered to~100,000 crypto fanatics — all of whom could become new customers to grow your business.
