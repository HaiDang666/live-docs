# Reseller API Endpoints

For details about the API endpoints, see the [Reseller API Endpoint Specification](https://apidocs.unstoppabledomains.com/#tag/reseller). These endpoints are specified in OpenAPI format, which provides an interactive API explorer in which you can try out sample API calls.

There are five endpoints in the Reseller API:

* **Domain Name Availability**: checks availability of domain name before purchase
* **Buy Domain**: used for buying domains from UD
* **Order Status**: checks blockchain transaction status to see if it is successfully “mined”
* **User Status**: checks if user has a domain and whether they are eligible for a free domain
* **Reverse Lookup**: used to get all domains that are connected to certain owner

If you need assistance with any of the API endpoints, please join our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/b6ZVxSZ9Hn) for real-time support from UD and the community.
