# Reseller API Endpoints

For details about the API endpoints, see the [Reseller API Endpoint Specification](https://apidocs.unstoppabledomains.com/#tag/reseller). These endpoints are specified in OpenAPI format, which provides an interactive API explorer in which you can try out sample API calls.

There are six endpoints in the Reseller API:

* `GET`** Domain Name Availability**: checks availability of domain name before purchase
* `POST`** Buy Domain**: used for buying domains from UD
* `GET`** Order Status**: checks blockchain transaction status to see if it is successfully “mined”
* `GET`** User Status**: checks if user has a domain and whether they are eligible for a free domain
* `GET`** Reverse Lookup**: used to get all domains that are connected to certain owner
* `GET `**Get domains variations:** used to provide domains variants based on provided domains and labels. Method will provide domains similar to domains provided in domains parameter.
